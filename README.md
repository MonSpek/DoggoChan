This is a fairly simple bot that runs on node.js with discord.js. It was made as an intro porject to JS for myself.

## Getting Started

If you want to use the code in the bot you will need to set up a mongod database and make a config file. But it was only meant for me to use.

### Prerequisites

This project has a config file (botconfig.json) that is hidden with a .gitignore, in this file there are hex color values that are used throughout the project.

## Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - the framework used
* [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) - The API framework used
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Database used

## Contributing

Please edit and change my code in any way!
